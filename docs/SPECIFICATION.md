# Thirsty-lang Language Specification

## Version 1.0.0

## Introduction

Thirsty-lang is a simple, interpreted programming language with water-themed keywords designed to make programming fun and accessible.

## Syntax

### Comments

Comments start with `//` and continue to the end of the line:

```thirsty
// This is a comment
```

### Variables

Variables are declared using the `drink` keyword:

```thirsty
drink varname = value
```

Variable names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

### Data Types

Thirsty-lang supports the following data types:

- **Strings**: Text enclosed in double quotes `"` or single quotes `'`
- **Numbers**: Integer or floating-point numbers

Examples:
```thirsty
drink message = "Hello"
drink count = 42
drink temperature = 98.6
```

### Output

The `pour` keyword outputs a value to the console:

```thirsty
pour "Hello, World!"
pour varname
```

### Input

The `sip` keyword reads input from the user:

```thirsty
sip username
```

### Control Flow

The `thirsty` keyword creates a conditional (if) statement:

```thirsty
drink temperature = 25

thirsty temperature > 30 {
  pour "It's hot!"
}
```

The `hydrated` keyword provides an else clause:

```thirsty
drink age = 21

thirsty age >= 18 {
  pour "You are an adult"
}
hydrated {
  pour "You are a minor"
}
```

### Loops

The `refill` keyword creates a while-style loop:

```thirsty
drink water = 3

refill water > 0 {
  pour water
  drink water = water - 1
}
```

### Arithmetic Operations

Thirsty-lang supports standard arithmetic operators:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division

```thirsty
drink result = 10 + 5 * 2  // Result: 20 (proper precedence)
pour result
```

### Comparison Operators

- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal
- `<=` Less than or equal
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to

```thirsty
drink a = 10
drink b = 5

thirsty a > b {
  pour "a is greater"
}
```

### String Concatenation

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator:

```thirsty
drink greeting = "Hello, " + "World!"
pour greeting
```

### Security Features

Thirsty-lang includes defensive programming features:

- `shield` - Protected code blocks
- `sanitize` - HTML encoding to prevent XSS
- `armor` - Variable protection against modification
- `morph` - Dynamic code mutation (placeholder)
- `detect` - Threat monitoring (placeholder)
- `defend` - Automated countermeasures (placeholder)

```thirsty
shield secureApp {
  drink userData = "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
  sanitize userData
  pour userData  // Outputs: &lt;script&gt;...
}
```

## Reserved Keywords

- `drink` - Variable declaration
- `pour` - Output/print
- `sip` - Input
- `thirsty` - If statement
- `hydrated` - Else statement
- `refill` - Loop
- `shield` - Protected code block
- `sanitize` - HTML encoding
- `armor` - Variable protection
- `morph` - Code mutation
- `detect` - Threat monitoring
- `defend` - Automated countermeasures
- `glass` - Function declaration (planned)

## Future Features

The following features are planned for future releases:

1. Functions (`glass` keyword)
2. Arrays and data structures
3. Classes and OOP
4. Modules and imports
5. Async/await

## Examples

### Hello World

```thirsty
drink message = "Hello, World!"
pour message
```

### Multiple Variables

```thirsty
drink water = "H2O"
drink temperature = 25
drink liters = 2.5

pour water
pour temperature
pour liters
```

## Grammar (BNF)

```
program        ::= statement*

statement      ::= drink_stmt
                 | pour_stmt
                 | sip_stmt
                 | thirsty_stmt
                 | refill_stmt
                 | shield_stmt
                 | sanitize_stmt
                 | armor_stmt
                 | morph_stmt
                 | detect_stmt
                 | defend_stmt
                 | comment

drink_stmt     ::= "drink" identifier "=" expression
pour_stmt      ::= "pour" expression
sip_stmt       ::= "sip" identifier

thirsty_stmt   ::= "thirsty" condition block ("hydrated" block)?
refill_stmt    ::= "refill" condition block
shield_stmt    ::= "shield" identifier block

sanitize_stmt  ::= "sanitize" identifier
armor_stmt     ::= "armor" identifier

morph_stmt     ::= "morph" "on:" "[" string_list "]"
detect_stmt    ::= "detect" identifier
defend_stmt    ::= "defend" "with:" string

block          ::= "{" statement* "}"
condition      ::= expression comparison expression
comparison     ::= ">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=" | "==" | "!="

expression     ::= term (("+"|"-") term)*
term           ::= factor (("*"|"/") factor)*
factor         ::= number | string | identifier | "(" expression ")"

identifier     ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
string         ::= '"' [^"]* '"' | "'" [^']* "'"
number         ::= [0-9]+ ("." [0-9]+)?
string_list    ::= string ("," string)*
comment        ::= "//" [^\n]*
```

## Error Handling

The interpreter will report errors for:
- Unknown statements
- Invalid syntax
- Undefined variables
- Type mismatches (in future versions)

## Conclusion

Thirsty-lang is designed to be simple and fun. Stay hydrated and happy coding! 💧
