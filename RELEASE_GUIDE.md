## 🔧 Release Commands

### Manual Release Process

```bash

# 1. Ensure everything is committed

git status

# 2. Run all tests

npm test
npm run test:all

# 3. Update version (patch/minor/major)

npm version patch  # or minor, or major

# This automatically runs tests, commits, and creates a tag

# 4. Push to GitHub

git push && git push --tags

# 5. Publish to NPM

npm publish

# 6. Verify installation

npm install -g Thirsty-Lang@latest
thirsty --version
```

### Automated Release Process

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs on every push and PR
   - Tests on multiple Node.js versions
   - Builds and archives artifacts
   - Generates documentation

2. **NPM Publishing** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)
   - Triggers on GitHub Releases
   - Runs tests before publishing
   - Publishes to NPM registry
   - Uploads release assets

#### Using GitHub Actions

1. **Create a Release on GitHub:**

   ```bash

   # Tag and push

   git tag v2.0.0
   git push origin v2.0.0

   # Create release via GitHub UI or CLI

   gh release create v2.0.0 --title "v2.0.0" --notes "Release notes..."
   ```

2. **The workflow will automatically:**
   - Run all tests
   - Verify package contents
   - Publish to NPM
   - Attach tarball to release

## 🔐 NPM Publishing Setup

### First-Time Setup

1. **Create NPM Account** (if needed)

   ```bash
   npm adduser
   ```

2. **Generate NPM Token** (for CI/CD)
   - Log in to npmjs.com
   - Navigate to Access Tokens
   - Generate new token (Automation type)
   - Add to GitHub Secrets as `NPM_TOKEN`

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   - Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add `NPM_TOKEN` with your npm token

### Testing Package Before Publishing

```bash

# Create a test package

npm pack

# Inspect contents

tar -tzf Thirsty-Lang-2.0.0.tgz

# Test installation locally

npm install -g ./Thirsty-Lang-2.0.0.tgz

# Test CLI commands

thirsty --help
thirsty examples/hello.thirsty
thirsty-repl
```

### "You do not have permission to publish"

- Ensure you're logged in: `npm whoami`
- Check package name isn't taken
- Verify npm account has 2FA enabled

### "Version already published"

- Can't republish same version
- Increment version and try again
- Use `npm version` to bump version

### "Tests failed during prepublishOnly"

- All tests must pass before publishing
- Fix failing tests
- Run `npm test` locally first

### "Tag already exists"

- Delete remote tag: `git push --delete origin vX.X.X`
- Delete local tag: `git tag -d vX.X.X`
- Create new tag with corrected version
